=API Documentation=
The OTPauth php library is a small set of functions, but they are well-documented. It is not class-based, but rather functional. Therefore, it will work with both php4 and php5. The API documentation can be found at [http://code.google.com/p/otpauth/docs]

=Developer Integration=
Developer integration:
  # Run generator() function in otp.php from administrative page to generate user list
  # Use valid_otp() function in otp.php at auth time to determine if auth is valid
